# Taxonomy of Everything as Code (EaC)

This taxonomy organizes "Everything as Code" (EaC) practices across functional domains of modern software delivery. Practices are classified as Established (ðŸŸ¥), Emerging (ðŸŸ¦), or Speculative (ðŸŸ©), based on adoption, tool support, and presence in the literature.
