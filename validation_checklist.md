# 1. Validation Checklist for the Taxonomy

This checklist rigorously evaluates all aspects of the taxonomy, ensuring it aligns with literature, is logically consistent, and is clearly defined.

### Taxonomy Validation Checklist

| **Criteria** | **Description** | **Evaluation** | **Comments** |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Alignment with Existing Literature** | Does the taxonomy reflect the terminology, definitions, and practices found in existing literature on EaC? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Cite specific literature or sources that either align or diverge. |
| **Clarity of Definitions** | Are all terms used in the taxonomy clearly defined and easily distinguishable? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Identify ambiguous or unclear definitions if any. |
| **Scope and Completeness** | Does the taxonomy cover all known “as-code” practices, both established and emerging? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Highlight any gaps or missing practices in the taxonomy. |
| **Granularity of Categories** | Are the categories in the taxonomy neither too broad nor too narrow? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Provide feedback on whether some categories need further breakdown or merging. |
| **Consistency Across Dimensions** | Are the two dimensions (Industry Awareness & Tooling Support, Functional Roles & Implementation Areas) internally consistent and logically organized? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Describe any overlap or logical inconsistencies between the dimensions. |
| **Inter-Categorical Relationships** | Are the relationships between the categories (e.g., overlaps, dependencies, integrations) clearly defined and logically sound? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Point out any ambiguous or unsubstantiated relationships. |
| **Real-World Applicability** | Does the taxonomy reflect real-world applications and industry use of EaC practices? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Mention specific use cases or industries that validate or contradict the taxonomy. |
| **Scalability for New Practices** | Is the taxonomy flexible enough to incorporate new practices or evolving concepts in the future? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Suggest how the taxonomy could accommodate future expansions or changes. |
| **Practical Utility** | Will the taxonomy be useful for practitioners (e.g., DevOps engineers) to implement or adopt “as-code” practices? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Provide feedback on whether the taxonomy is actionable for industry professionals. |
| **Cross-Dimensional Consistency** | Are practices placed consistently within their correct dimensions (e.g., no practice wrongly assigned between Industry Awareness and Tooling Support vs. Functional Roles)? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Flag any practices that seem out of place in the taxonomy. |
| **Terminological Precision** | Are the terms used in the taxonomy consistent in their usage across the dimensions and categories? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Identify any inconsistencies or confusing terminology. |
| **Expert Consensus on Categories** | Have multiple experts reviewed and agreed on the categories and relationships in the taxonomy? | (Yes/No/Partial) | State the degree of consensus among experts. |
| **Rationale Behind Categories** | Is the reasoning behind each category and subcategory clearly justified and aligned with theoretical foundations? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Provide reasoning or sources that support the categorization choices. |

# 2. Validation Checklist for the Conceptual Model

This checklist validates the conceptual model's accuracy, completeness, clarity, and practical utility, with emphasis on the relationships and interactions between "as-code" practices.

### Conceptual Model Validation Checklist

| **Criteria** | **Description** | **Evaluation** | **Comments** |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Empirical Foundation** | Is the model built on a solid foundation of data derived from literature (both academic and grey)? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Cite literature that supports the relationships shown in the model. |
| **Clear Representation of Relationships** | Are the relationships between practices (e.g., overlaps, integrations, dependencies) clearly and accurately represented? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Identify any relationships that seem unclear or misrepresented. |
| **Consistency with Taxonomy** | Does the conceptual model align with the taxonomy in terms of categories, definitions, and boundaries? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Point out any discrepancies between the model and the taxonomy. |
| **Lifecycle Alignment** | Does the model accurately reflect the stages of the DevOps lifecycle (e.g., provisioning, deployment, monitoring) in the context of EaC? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Flag any stages missing from the lifecycle or misaligned with the model. |
| **Granularity of Interaction Representation** | Are the interactions between practices represented at an appropriate level of detail? (i.e., not too granular or overly abstract) | (Yes/No/Partial) | Suggest adjustments to the level of detail. |
| **Mapping of Practices to Lifecycle** | Are practices appropriately mapped to specific stages of the software delivery lifecycle? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Identify if any practice is placed in an illogical lifecycle phase. |
| **Categorization of Practices** | Are all practices (IaC, CaC, PaC, SaC, etc.) correctly placed and well-defined in the model? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Provide feedback on any miscategorization or confusion. |
| **External Tool Integration** | Does the model effectively include the integration of industry tools and platforms used for each practice (e.g., Terraform, Ansible, OPA)? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Specify any tools or platforms not reflected in the model but relevant. |
| **Representation of Overlaps and Dependencies** | Are overlapping or dependent practices (e.g., PaC and CoaC) clearly defined and logically depicted in the model? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Flag any overlaps or dependencies that are not adequately addressed. |
| **Practical Application** | Is the conceptual model useful in real-world scenarios for practitioners to understand how to integrate various "as-code" practices in a cohesive pipeline or workflow? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Provide examples of how this model can be used or improved in practice. |
| **Scalability of the Model** | Can the conceptual model be easily adapted as new "as-code" practices emerge, or as existing practices evolve? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Suggest ways the model can be made more flexible for future additions. |
| **Visual Clarity** | Is the model visually clear, with easy-to-understand relationships and hierarchies between practices? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Provide feedback on any visual improvements for better clarity. |
| **Expert Consensus on Relationships** | Have domain experts agreed on the relationships, categories, and interactions represented in the model? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Report any disagreement or need for further refinement from experts. |
| **Adaptability to Evolving Practices** | Does the model accommodate new or emerging "as-code" practices while retaining its structural integrity? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Provide suggestions for making the model more adaptable. |
| **Interdisciplinary Relevance** | Does the model bridge gaps between software engineering, DevOps, and broader enterprise architecture practices? | (Yes/No/Partial) | Discuss any interdisciplinary insights gained or areas of improvement. |

### **Methodology for Applying the Checklists**

1. **Expert Selection**: Choose a panel of subject matter experts (SMEs) in the fields of DevOps, cloud-native technologies, and "as-code" practices. The panel should include both academic researchers and industry practitioners to ensure comprehensive validation.

2. **Pre-Validation Training**: Brief experts on the taxonomy, conceptual model, and the validation process. Provide context to ensure consistent evaluation across the panel.

3. **Checklist Evaluation**: Experts individually complete the checklists for both the taxonomy and conceptual model, providing ratings (Yes/No/Partial) and justifications for each item.

4. **Consensus-Building**: After individual evaluations, hold a consensus-building session where experts discuss their findings, address discrepancies, and refine the taxonomy and model.

5. **Iterative Refinement**: Based on expert feedback, revise the taxonomy or model. This process can be repeated for further rounds of validation if significant changes are made.

6. **Final Review**: After final revisions, have experts review the updated version for confirmation. Once validated, the taxonomy and model can be considered ready for publication.
